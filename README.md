**Call for code submission for COVID-19 track.**

PocketCare S is a comprehensive smartphone-based solution for monitoring close encounters. It is a bluetooth low energy (BLE) based solution which enables smartphones to send and receive anonymous beacon signals. It checks the distance between a smartphone and another beacon (or smartphone running PocketCare S) to see if they are close to each other (less than 2m). If so, the smartphone records the duration of such a close encounter with another beacon. 

PocketCare S is designed to report social distance information without collecting or revealing any personally identifiable information about any specific individual.

## The Architecture

![Architecture](assets/PocketCareS_Design_Simplified.png)

## Getting Started 

**Due to emulators not supporting bluetooth, close encounter detection will not work on emulators.**

### Prerequisites



### Running PocketCare S using Xcode



## How does PocketCare S Work?

### Key Highlights (Mobile Application)

1. Close encounter data will be displayed in the mobile application after a close encounter session starts. A close encounter session starts when two people are within **2 meters** for at least **5 minutes**. 
2. The **virtual bluetooth name** changes every hour to ensure **user privacy**. 
3. Data upload to the server takes place every hour.
4. Data is stored in user's phone for a maximum of 14 days. 

### Detailed Architecture

### Technological Advances

PocketCare S has made significant technological advances compared to other solutions. An Infographic with this information can be found [here](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/content/dam/engineering/computer-science-engineering/images/pocketcare/PocketCareS-TechAdvances.pdf).

### Security and Privacy 

PocketCare S cares values the security and privacy of its users. The app does not collect any private information about an individual person.  All the data collected is anonymous and will not reveal any personally identifiable information. An Infographic with this information can be found [here](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/content/dam/engineering/computer-science-engineering/images/pocketcare/PocketCareS.pdf).

## Built With 

In this submission, we have used IBM’s Cloud **Red Hat OpenShift** to deploy our server (using **OpenJDK 8**), database (using **MongoDB**), the web portal (using **Node Js server**) and **IBM Push notification service** from **IBM Bluemix** in the android application of PocketCare S as a proof of concept. In the future, we will consider integrating other IBM services into the PocketCare S solution.
